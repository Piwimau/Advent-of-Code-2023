# üéÑ Advent of Code 2023 üéÑ

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023),
my third year of participation.

## What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a series of small programming puzzles created by
[Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). Every day from December 1st to 25th, a puzzle is released alongside an
engaging fictional Christmas story. Each puzzle consists of two parts, the second of which usually
contains some interesting twist or changing requirements and is only unlocked after completing the
first one. The objective is to solve all parts and collect fifty stars ‚≠ê until December 25th to
save Christmas.

Many users compete on the [global leaderboard](https://adventofcode.com/2023/leaderboard) by solving
the puzzles in an unbelievably fast way in order to get some extra points. Personally, I see Advent
of Code as a fun exercise to do during the Advent season while waiting for Christmas. I often use it
to learn a new programming language (like I did in 2021 with `C#`) or some advanced programming
concepts. I can only encourage you to participate as well - of course in a way that you find fun.
